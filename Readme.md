# Missing value processing

In data analysis, our datasets may contain missing values for various reasons. They are often encoded as NaNs, blanks or any other placeholders. When training our model with a dataset that has a lot of missing values can drastically impact the machine learning modelâ€™s quality.

# Methods for outlier detection

* Imputation Using (Mean) Values:

### Requirement
- pandas==0.23.0
- numpy==1.15.4
- sklearn==0.20.2

### Todos

* Using (Most Frequent) or (Zero/Constant) Values
* Using Median
